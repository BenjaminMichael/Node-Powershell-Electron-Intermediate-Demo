# My learning tutorial
## based on [Xainey's PowerShell-Electron-Demo](https://github.com/Xainey/powershell-electron-demo)

I wanted to take the PowerShell Electron concept a bit further and come up with a solution to a common problem presented by my coworker involving comparing AD groups of existing staff and new hires. (later a feature request was submitted by another colleague for the scenario where we remove AD group memberships after termination).

To run this demo you will need the following installed:
node,
Windows PowerShell,
you need to be on a Domain joined workstation that can communicate with a Domain Controller.
you will need [Powershell Access Control Module](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShellAccessControl-d3be7b83) to be in one of your PS modules directories.
